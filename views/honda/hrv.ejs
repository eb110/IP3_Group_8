					<h1>Honda HR-V</h1>

					<p>The Honda HR-V is a subcompact, front-engine, four passenger, front- or all-wheel drive crossover SUV, manufactured and marketed by Honda over two generations.

						The first generation HR-V was based on the Honda Logo; was marketed from 1999-2006 in Europe, Japan and select Asia-Pacific markets â€” and featured three doors (1999-2003) or five doors (1999-2006). The two configurations were internally designated GH2 and GH4 respectively.
						
						After a hiatus between 2006 and 2013, Honda reintroduced the nameplate for the second generation HR-V, based on the third-generation Honda Fit. Production began in late 2013 for the JDM (as the Vezel) and in 2015 in North America, Australia, Brazil and select Asian markets as the HR-V. </p>
