					<h1>BMW Series 1</h1>
					<p>The BMW 1 Series is a range of subcompact executive cars (C-segment) manufactured by BMW since 2004. It is the successor to the BMW 3 Series Compact and is currently in its third generation.

						The first generation was produced in hatchback, coupe and convertible body styles. Since the second generation (introduced in 2013), the coup√© and convertible models have been marketed as the 2 Series, therefore the 1 Series range no longer includes these body styles. A sedan model became available for the Chinese market in 2017. </p>
